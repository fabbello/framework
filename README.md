#Framework | FÃ¡bio Barbosa#

A CSS boilerplate, written in Sass with SCSS syntax, including a set of normalizing styles, a typographic system including tools for a modular scale, and a simple and semantic grid system. A LESS port is on my plans.

Inspired and modified from semantic.gs, typeplate.com and of course normalize.css.

I believe the essentials of the web media are typography and layout. Use this if you need a lean, stylistically non-opinionated ground for your web projects.

In the future, this project should evolve into a boilerplate component for all technologies of front-end developing, sensible to scaffolding solutions like Bower/Yeoman, and automated workflows like Grunt.js. 

There should be several code and structure changes soon. Stay tuned.
